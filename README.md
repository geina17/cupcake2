# cupcakes
#Function
When a user submits an order (a cupcakes name), the app will display the cupcakes on the left side of the page -- waiting to be eat'in.

Each cupcake in the 'Edibled' area has a order button. When the user clicks it, the cupcake will move to the right side of the page -- into the 'eat'in' section.

All cupcakes are stored in the database, whether eat'in or not.
